# SECAproject1 - Racing in the Blizzard

This project utilizes Java and Processing for a 2 player car racing game.

The goal of this project was to wisely use Object Oriented Programming and Java Classes to create a game.  Another goal was to comprehend and utilize the asthetic capabilites of processing.

## The approach was to create a basic MVP project which included the blow and all of which were accomplished:
* 2 cars, each which was activated on a separate click event
* Leader board storing a win count
* Game resetting (yet storing win data) upon a user winning

## Post MVP items that were accomplished:
* utilizing images for cars instead of the processing "rect" function
* adding in a visual layer- decided on snow


## What's next:
* Gaining & Storing user information to display user’s name on screen instead of “Player 1”
* Adding Obstacles as the cars are Racing
* Option to play against computer



## Wins:
* Had never written a Line of Java until Monday & created fully functioning game


## Challenges:
* time constraints- would have liked to implement more features with more time
